    <h1>Aiko Takahashi — The Grass Harp</h1>

    <p>
        In November 2023, Aiko Takahashi released It Could Have Been A Beautiful as a part of the IIKKI series (the book/CD combinations). 
        She now returns with The Grass Harp on the Spring edition for Laaps Records which, like IIKKI is also curated by Mathias van Eeclo. 
        Van Eecloo specifically asked Takahashi to create ‘a new complete piece of sounds’ for the Laaps label.
