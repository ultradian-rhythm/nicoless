			<p>
				In a perfect world, people would buy albums on Bandcamp or Apple Music and then just stream the music they like (and for free) instead of random tracks from playlists and paying for that every month. 
				People would spend less money, but would give so much more to the artists rather than the streaming company.

			<h2><a href="#old-school-blog-posts">Old School Blog Posts</a></h2>
			<p>
				I'm starting to think these blogs from 2004 worked better for artists than today's social media platforms and their focus on ephemeral content. 
				As a consumer, I don't want to follow artists and scroll through random postings. And I don't need daily updates. 
				I just want to spend some time now and then reading about what they're currently working on or getting an idea of who they are. 
				So I thought maybe others feel the same and might want to explore the person behind the music, just for a while. 
				Therefore, I redesigned my website into a very simple blog for infrequent posts about various topics.
