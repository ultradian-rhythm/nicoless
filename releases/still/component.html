	<p>Still came about while I was working on the third album for my project ultradian. It started with three tracks where I wanted to move more towards ambient music with dense, deep soundscapes and long, narrative compositions using acoustic sounds. Putting both together is what makes it interesting to me.</p>

		Platonic and gloomy atmospheres, from which you can glimpse a glimmer of romance and positivity. The producer Nico Less with his latest work, "Everybody Needs to Come Down", unleashes in us a whirlwind of conflicting emotions, with which it is not difficult to admit that we are dealing with a work of the highest quality, which is truly a pleasure to listen to.

		Nico, a gentleman we also featured a couple of weeks ago has fast risen to become one of our favourite new ambient producers.
